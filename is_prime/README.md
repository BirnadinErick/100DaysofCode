# IS PRIME

> prime number guessing name inspired by tinder

**SOURCE**. Prime numbers used in this project are from t5k.org; their first
10k Primes list is used here. Grab the list https://t5k.org/lists/small/10000.txt
here.

### Preprocessing

Since the sorce is in text format the `parse_txt.py` will parse the file into
CSV file needed for the application. The source fill should be in the cwd as 
the python file is. And there should not be any files named `primes.txt`. *No
third-party library needed, just Python3 standard library*.
